## What it Does
Our project uses AI to provide reliable information about medicine like its side effects, uses, nutritional value, and how much it costs. We also have similar features for vaccines where people can learn facts about vaccines and whether they need it or not. Another feature we have is that the user can see how to treat their illness that they have. Some smaller features include a BMI calculator that can help calculate the user's BMI so that they can track if they are healthy or unhealthy.

# Clone the github code

## Tools
We used ReactJS, NextJS Framework, and Tailwind CSS for our frontend side of the code, and for the backend we used GPT-4, BerriAI, and LangChain.js
